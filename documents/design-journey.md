# Project 3: Design Journey

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Design Plan

### Project 1 or 2
> Do you plan to reuse your Project 1 or 2 site?
> Which project?

TODO

> If yes, please include sketches of the site's current design (you may copy the "final" sections from those assignments.)

TODO


### Describe your Media Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your collection be about?
> What type of media will your site display? (images, videos, audio)

TODO


### Audiences (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audiences. Be specific and justify why each audience is appropriate for your site.
> You are required to have **two** audiences: "information consumers" and "site administrators"

Information Consumer: TODO

Site Administrator: TODO


### Personas (Milestone 1)
> Your personas must have a name and a "depiction". This can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.
> There is no required format for the persona.
> You may type out the persona below with bullet points or include an image of the persona. Just make sure it's easy to read the persona when previewing markdown.
> Your personas should focus on the goals, obstacles, and factors that influence behavior of each audience.

> Persona for your "consumer" audience:

TODO


> Persona for your "administrator" audience:

TODO


### Site Design (Milestone 1)
> Document your _entire_ design process. **We want to see iteration!**
> Show us the evolution of your design from your first idea (sketch) to the final design you plan to implement (sketch).
> Show us the process you used to organize content and plan the navigation, if applicable (card sorting).
> Plan your URLs for the site.
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each design artifact. Explain what the artifact is, how it meets the goals of your personas (**refer to your personas by name**).
> Clearly label the final design.

TODO


### Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Write a one paragraph reflection explaining how you used the design patterns in your site's design.

TODO



## Implementation Plan

### Requests (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Identify and plan each request you will support in your design.
> List each request that you will need (e.g. view image details, view gallery, edit book, tag product, etc.)
> For each request, specify the request type (GET or POST), how you will initiate the request: (form or query string URL), and the HTTP parameters necessary for the request.

Example:
- Request: view movie details
  - Type: GET
  - URL: /movie/details?id=X
  - Params: id _or_ movie_id (movies.id in DB)

TODO


### Database Schema (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Describe the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture. A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this. Make sure you include constraints for each field.

> Hint: You probably need a table for "entries", `tags`, `"entry"_tags` (stores relationship between entries and tags), and a `users` tables.

> Hint: For foreign keys, use the singular name of the table + _id. For example: `image_id` and `tag_id` for the `image_tags` (tags for each image) table.

Table: movies
- field1: TYPE {constraints...},
- field2...
- TODO


### Database Query Plan (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Plan your database queries. You may use natural language, pseudocode, or SQL.

TODO


### Code Planning (Milestone 1. Revise in Milestone 2)
> Plan any PHP code you'll need here using pseudocode.
> Use this space to plan out your form validation and assembling the SQL queries, etc.
> Tip: Break this up by pages. It makes it easier to plan.

```
TODO: WRITE YOUR PSEUDOCODE HERE, between the back-tick lines.
```


## Submission

### Audience (Final Submission)
> Tell us how your final site meets the needs of the audiences. Be specific here. Tell us how you tailored your design, content, etc. to make your website usable for your personas. Refer to the personas by name.

TODO


### Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. You don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey.

TODO


### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What things did you have trouble with?

TODO


### Grading: Mobile or Desktop (Final Submission)
> When we grade your final site, should we grade this with a mobile screen size or a desktop screen size?

TODO


### Grading: Step-by-Step Instructions (Final Submission)
> Write step-by-step instructions for the graders.
> The project if very hard to grade if we don't understand how your site works.
> For example, you must login before you can delete.
> For each set of instructions, assume the grader is starting from /
